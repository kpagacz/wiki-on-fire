## Contribution
### Design pattern
We follow the MCVS pattern, where our view is covered by the Vue.js frontend. The backend is responsible for writing routes, controllers, services and data models. Have a look at the example of a CRUD API in here and treat it as a small guide: https://www.callicoder.com/node-js-express-mongodb-restful-crud-api-tutorial/

### API responses
giddy-banana accepts and responds in JSON.
